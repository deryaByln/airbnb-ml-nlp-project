#  Airbnb Recommendation System, Clustering, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

In this project, a content-based recommendation system was developed for Airbnb listings. Additionally, clustering and natural language processing (NLP) techniques were used to analyze listing data. Users can receive suggestions for listings similar to ones they previously liked or discover similar listings based on their own preferences.

##  Project Features

- A system that recommends similar Airbnb listings
- Grouping of listings through Clustering (using unsupervised learning)
- Text analysis of listing descriptions using NLP techniques

##  Data Used

- 13,000+ Airbnb listings
- Includes textual, numerical, and categorical features such as: descriptions, price, location, number of rooms, reviews, etc.

##  Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values by filling or removing them
- Encoding categorical features using OrdinalEncoder and OneHotEncoder
- Scaling numerical features with StandardScaler
- Cleaning and tokenizing text data

## Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- UMAP, MiniBatchKMeans
- TextBlob, Wordcloud, NLTK
- Streamlit, Bokeh, Matplotlib
